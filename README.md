# ChickenRace
### A bot that takes advantage of a bookmaker to generate money


Useing a chromedriver with a webscraper we can automatically snipe the free races that this bookmarker gives us sometimes. You just need to have an Ethereum Wallet and some chickens on it.

This bot has been working very well for some months generating 10 to 30 usd per day. But now, they did introduce a ReCaptcha before you can click on 'Enter Race' (they caught me :S)
There are some ways to avoid this ej(anti-captcha.com) 
I still have to update the bot
